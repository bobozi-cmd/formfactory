## 📖 Overview
Online form filling is one of the most common—yet most labor-intensive—daily tasks. Traditional automation tools are usually rule-based scripts that struggle with complex and ever-changing web layouts. With the recent rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (**MLLMs**), researchers have begun to explore vision-language agents capable of "one-click" form completion. However, current models still fall short in layout understanding and field–value alignment.

**FormFactory** bridges this gap by providing a high-fidelity benchmark and experimentation platform for multimodal form-filling agents. The project consists of:

1. 🌐 **Web Front-End** – 40+ high-fidelity HTML forms from real-world scenarios spanning eight domains (academia, business, finance, healthcare, etc.).
2. 🗄 **Dataset** –
   • `data1/` contains JSON **gold answers** (ground-truth field values) for each form.
   • `data2/` stores supporting **textual materials** that can be used as additional context or prompts.
   • `labeled-images/` provides page **screenshots** and corresponding **bbox annotations** (organized by folders A–H).
3. ⚙️ **Back-End Service** – A lightweight Flask API that renders pages, receives submissions, and saves results automatically.
4. 📊 **Evaluation Scripts** – Utilities for computing field-level and form-level accuracy, layout reasoning metrics, and more.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1  Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.8
- Flask == 2.3.*
- Install additional dependencies with:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 2  Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/formfactory-ai/formfactory.git
cd formfactory
```

### 3  Run Demo Server
```bash
python app.py        # default: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
Open the URL in your browser, pick any form from the dashboard, and start interacting.
